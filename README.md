# pollution-detector

Project developed to automate air traffic in my house.

It contains:

1. Arduino Uno.
2. Pollution detector.
3. Logic converter.
4. Relay 5V/230V.

When detector finds that air quality is poor, it cut off power from recuperator.

Logic is written in Arduino Environment.

Detector communicates with Arduino through UART interface.
